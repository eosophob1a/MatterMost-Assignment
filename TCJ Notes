Required software to run vagrantfile

Vagrant
Ansible
VirtualBox (used as Vagrant Provisioner)
Add mmlab.planetexpress.com to your hosts file at 192.168.50.50

Tested on

Mac OS X 10.15.6
Fedora 32

Started process initializing provisioning guest using MM documentation site as a reference
Fiddled with python2 dependencies to get ansible provisioner to work with 18.04; there were some dependencies that were required to utilize the postgres modules
During setup of the database I ran in to issues setting up database and database users.  I resolved this by separating the step out and changing user to the postgres user to test permissions to DB
Got hung with config.json and best way to template using vagrant decided to pre-create required files for configuration and use vagrant's shared file structure to stage all required files
Ran in to an issue with setting up OpenLDAP unattended due to prompts like setting root password for the directory ; Asked Sven about using docker image of OpenLDAP that was used by icelander (Paul)
in their LDAP test.  Sven was ok with this so implemented this as a solution for LDAP.  Updated the config.json to connect MatterMost instance to this LDAP.
Installed reverse-proxy with nginx using the MatterMost documentation site without incident
Used openssl to create a self-signed certificate and stage it in appropriate location as part of initial provisioning and updated the nginx configuration to listen on SSL using self-signed certs
Tested all functionality on local dev box (Mac OS X)
Tested on Fedora 32 instance independent hardware
General cleaup on code and file structure of GH
Tested several times on desktop to document requirements
